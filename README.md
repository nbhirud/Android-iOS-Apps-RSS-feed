# iOS-Apps-RSS-feed
This Android application makes simple HTTP request and parses iTunes RSS feed data, and we focus on the iOS Apps RSS feed. The application displays 100 top grossing applications provided by the iTunes store.

See directory PizzaStore/Readme for details:

Note: This is not a completed application, and is intended to be "as is" when created within the 3 hour window we used to have during our Mobile Application Development (MAD) using Android lectures. The application may or may not be complete, and may also have additional functionality if I felt like working on them later.
